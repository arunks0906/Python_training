Python's standard library includes a wide range of modules readily available for use without requiring external installation. These modules provide functionalities for various tasks, from basic operations to more complex functionalities. Some commonly used standard modules include: 

• math: For mathematical functions and constants (e.g., math.pi, math.sqrt()). 
• random: For generating random numbers (e.g., random.randint(), random.random()). 
• datetime: For working with dates and times (e.g., datetime.datetime.now(), datetime.timedelta). 
• os: For interacting with the operating system (e.g., os.path.exists(), os.listdir()). 
• sys: For system-specific parameters and functions (e.g., sys.argv, sys.exit()). 
• json: For encoding and decoding JSON data. 
• collections: For specialized container datatypes (e.g., collections.Counter, collections.defaultdict). 
• re: For regular expression operations. 
• time: For time-related functions (e.g., time.sleep(), time.time()). 
• string: For string operations and constants (e.g., string.ascii_letters, string.punctuation). 
• inspect: Provides tools for introspection, allowing you to examine the attributes of objects. 
• io: Provides tools for working with various types of I/O streams. 
• itertools: Provides functions for creating and working with iterators in an efficient way. 
• logging: Offers a flexible framework for logging events and debugging applications. 

These modules, among many others in the standard library, are accessed using the import statement. For example, to use the math module: 
import math
print(math.sqrt(25)) # Output: 5.0

It is worth noting that modules like NumPy, SciPy, pandas, and matplotlib are powerful tools commonly used in data science and scientific computing, but they are not part of Python's standard library and require separate installation.
